This is a site that was developed as a code-along from Colt Steele's Web Development course on Udemy. Definitely not an original project of mine, but this is a good example of some of the different packages I've worked with so far including: ejs, express, passport, mongoose, method-override, connect-flash, and more.

All in all, it was a good project that gave me exposure to a lot of different packages that I can work with in the future. I have plans to start on my own actually original project from scratch after this, and this was good practice.
