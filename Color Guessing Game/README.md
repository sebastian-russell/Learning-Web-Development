This is a "fun" color guessing game I wrote as a project for Colt Steele's "Web Development Bootcamp."

A random color is selected and displayed as an RGB value at the top, and the user is given either 3 or 6 (depending on easy/hard more) choice. When the user guesses the correct color, they win! The game will reset and they can try again.

This is one of the first sites I made using extensive JS functionality to change variables, add classes, run functions that do thinks like pick random colors, etc.
